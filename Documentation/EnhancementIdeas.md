# Enhancement Ideas

A brainstorm of ideas for the future of this game, not all of this has to be implemented and they may not all be good ideas, just something to get you started. Please remove things from this list if they have been done. Feel free to add new ideas!

## Improve existing functionality

- Improve the transition between levels
- Improve the way that player respawn works. Maybe they don't have to respawn when colliding with an enemy? Maybe they have an animation or flash red
- Add a menu option to view controls, and/or a button to view the controls
while playing, rather than showing them in the HUD
- Make a proper game over screen instead of just a message
- Make a proper game win screen instead of just a message

## Add new features

- Add a timer that times each level
- Add enemies that can move up and down
- Add different types of enemies or obstacles
- Add different types of gems into the game, maybe they each have their own mechanic?
- Add a way to get new lives (especially if the game grows in number of levels)
- Add a way to destroy enemies, such as pushing boxes into them, or maybe a way for the player to 'attack'
- Add a story or lore to the game
- Design more levels, consider how they can be made more challenging the higher the level

## Documentation and Refactoring

- Create a diagram such as a UML or control flow diagam for the program
- Create documentation such as a markdown file describing a list of different methods and what they do
- Refactor the code to be better encapsulated, e.g. perhaps a separate game.cpp and level.cpp files. Is there any redundant code?  Is there anything that can be separated into it's own function to reduce the size of the largest functions and files?
- Refactor the code to work with 2D arrays for the levels rather than needing to loop through 1D arrays constantly to check for collisions
- Could movement be improved? Could it be done through methods rather than being part of the animation files?
- Design a better debug output
